        <h1>About us</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
            CovAID is the joint <strong>initiative of 5 students from Sanskriti School, New Delhi</strong>. We have initiated a unified <strong>online platform for smooth and accurate dispersal of information</strong> regarding availability of Covid-19 resources in the National Capital Region. <strong>Verification takes place through direct contact (calls, messages, etc.) that involves pictorial proof</strong>. These verified updates are then posted on the platform at frequent, regular intervals.
            <br/><br/>
            With the recent upsurge in COVID-19 cases in Delhi and the NCR, a plethora of sources for information on availability of CoVid resources have started circulating. CovAID is a platform which facilitates smooth and accurate dispersal of information on the availability of beds, medicines, injections, etc. 
            <br/><br/>
            We will be making this possible by <strong>personally contacting hospitals and other organisations multiple times a day</strong> so as to <strong>update information in real-time as well as verify sources</strong>. This will help in eliminating outdated/false reports on availability. 
            <br/><br/>
            Alongside this, we have also be <strong>created a filter for conveniently searching Twitter updates regarding COVID-19 resources</strong> and availability. The nation has lost many lives due to inaccurate information dispersal. With our initiative, we hope to overcome this hurdle. 
            <br/><br/>
